## Pitch
Hello! I'm Muhammad Tariq, a data enthusiast with a passion to build pipeline to source data and transforming raw data into actionable insights. I'm a firm believer that every dataset holds a wealth of untapped potential, and I'm on a mission to uncover it.

Throughout my career, I've been laser-focused on helping businesses align with their goals by designing data pipelines, tracking data quality and deploying dynamic metrics to monitor impact. I've also leveraged mathematical and statistical models to predict future trends, keeping businesses one step ahead.

My work as a data analyst has led to tangible results, including a 12% revenue increase at Zoob Technologies and a 5% increase at Omno AI. These achievements are a testament to the power of data-driven decision making.

When I'm not deep in data, I enjoy bringing a touch of humor to the workplace. I believe that a good laugh not only makes the day more enjoyable but also sparks creativity and innovation.

My toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, DPLYR, Tableau, Power BI, TensorFlow, Keras, and AWS. But enough about me, I'm eager to hear about your data challenges and how I can help. Let's connect and harness the power of data science together!

### Prefect CDK Deployment
- Summary: The repository explains how to deploy a complete Prefect Orchestration layer using ECS Fargate on Ubuntu 18.04 or Amazon AMI.
    Starting with ECS Cluster setup and architecuture. Cluster type Fargate is used for this project. The architecture consists of one VPC consisting of 2 public subsnets spread across two availiablity zones. These public subnets are connected through an application load balancer and can access internet through NAT gateway. Each of the public subnets are running one Fargate container as a service all times.

    Other then the ones mentioned above, two S3 buckets would be required. One for saving flow storages and other for saving results of ELT task.

    The Dockerfile is build into an image and then its pushed to ECR public repository. This can be accessed here. This image is used as base container image for ECS task defination. The image is provided to Application Load Balanced Fargate Service in prefect_ecs_stack.py.

    As for ECS Cluster, it will be running two Containers, first will be running as a service, prefect backend Cloud, that will be polling prefect cloud api for workloads, once the a workload is available, the second container is started for resolving the prefect workload.
